        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a 23 year old webdeveloper in the making. This Website is my first
          Project and will also showcase other Projects I'm involved with as
          well as skills I've learned and how to contact me.
        </p>

          I've been enjoying playing with technology from a young age. Started
          with a Nintendo DS Lite I got for Christmas from my Parents to playing
          games on my Dads Computer. Later I got my first own Computer and
          started playing Games like Minecraft, made my first encounters with
          dodgy downloads offering "free" cheats (Only at the low cost of my Dad
          getting angry I dowloaded some Virus along with it). After learning my
          fair share of lessons in internet security and a couple of years went
          by I was suddenly in Highschool and had the chance to attend IT
          classes which I gladly did.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now in full blown puberty I started to learn coding in Java and also
          joined a club for programming little LEGO Roboters. Still not getting
          enough I was programming some Plugins for Minecraft at home watching
          all the tutorials I could find.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays I've started in a bootcamp for webdevelopment learning all
          kinds of things from HTML, React all the way to JavaScript and some
          basics for the backend.

            <p>
              The Plugin was used while playing on a Minecraft Server (Spigot
              1.20.1) with some friends. We got the idea for the Plugin because
              some of the friends we were playing with are muslim and pork is
              considered haram. In Minecraft you can usually eat pork but the
              Plugin will punish you if you do by strinking you with a lightning
              and turning the weather to a storm.
